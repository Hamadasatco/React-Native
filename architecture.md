# Bus Tickets App Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for the Bus Tickets App built with React Native. The architecture follows a modular approach with clear separation of concerns to ensure maintainability, scalability, and testability.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React Native
- **State Management**: Redux with Redux Toolkit
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **UI Components**: React Native Paper

## Component Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AuthComponent**
   - Handles user authentication flow
   - Manages login, registration, and password reset
   - Stores authentication tokens securely

2. **SearchComponent**
   - Provides search interface for bus routes
   - Handles filtering and sorting of search results
   - Communicates with API to fetch available buses

3. **BusListComponent**
   - Displays list of available buses
   - Shows bus details including operator, timings, and price
   - Allows sorting and filtering of results

4. **SeatSelectionComponent**
   - Renders interactive seat layout
   - Manages seat selection state
   - Validates seat selection rules

5. **BookingComponent**
   - Collects passenger information
   - Shows fare breakdown
   - Manages booking flow

6. **PaymentComponent**
   - Integrates with payment gateway
   - Handles different payment methods
   - Processes payment securely

7. **TicketComponent**
   - Generates digital ticket with QR code
   - Provides ticket details view
   - Handles ticket actions (cancel, reschedule)

8. **ProfileComponent**
   - Manages user profile information
   - Shows booking history
   - Handles account settings

### Navigation Flow

```
App
├── Auth Stack
│   ├── Login Screen
│   ├── Register Screen
│   └── Forgot Password Screen
└── Main Stack (Protected)
    ├── Tab Navigator
    │   ├── Home/Search Tab
    │   │   ├── Search Screen
    │   │   ├── Bus List Screen
    │   │   └── Bus Details Screen
    │   ├── My Tickets Tab
    │   │   ├── Upcoming Tickets Screen
    │   │   ├── Past Tickets Screen
    │   │   └── Ticket Details Screen
    │   └── Profile Tab
    │       ├── Profile Screen
    │       └── Settings Screen
    └── Modal Screens (Stack)
        ├── Seat Selection Screen
        ├── Passenger Info Screen
        ├── Payment Screen
        └── Booking Confirmation Screen
```

## State Management

### Redux Store Structure
```
store/
├── auth/         # Authentication state
├── search/       # Search parameters and results
├── booking/      # Current booking information
├── payment/      # Payment state
├── tickets/      # User's tickets
└── user/         # User profile information
```

### Data Flow
1. User interacts with UI components
2. Components dispatch actions to Redux
3. Reducers update the state based on actions
4. Components re-render with updated state
5. API calls are made through services
6. API responses update the Redux store

## API Integration

### Endpoints
- `/auth` - Authentication endpoints
- `/routes` - Bus route search and information
- `/booking` - Booking creation and management
- `/payment` - Payment processing
- `/tickets` - Ticket management

### API Service Structure
- API client configuration with Axios
- Request/response interceptors for authentication
- Error handling and retry logic
- Endpoint-specific service modules

## Offline Support
- Caching of user tickets using AsyncStorage
- Offline ticket viewing capability
- Synchronization when back online

## Security Considerations
- Secure storage of authentication tokens
- HTTPS for all API communications
- Input validation on all forms
- Secure handling of payment information

## Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading of screens
- Memoization of expensive computations
- Image optimization
- Minimizing re-renders

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions and reducers
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for main user flows
- End-to-end tests for critical paths

## Deployment Strategy
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Code signing and app store submission
- Beta testing distribution
- Production release management
